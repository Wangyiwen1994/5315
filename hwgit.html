      <h2>What is Docker</h2>
      <p>Docker is a tool designed to make it easier to create, deploy, and run applications by using containers. - "What is a Docker" https://opensource.com/resources/what-docker.</p>
      <h2>What is Git? Why do we need source code Version Control System?</h2>
      <p>Git is a distributed version control system for tracking changes in source code during software development. Because version control system can help a software team manage changes to source code over time, it keeps track of every modification to the code in a special kind of database.</p>
      <h2>Describe following terms: 1) local repo 2)remote repo 3) how to use GIT in Team Project - multiple developers work on the same project at the same time.</h2>
      <p>1) The local repository is a directory on the computer where Maven runs. It caches remote downloads and contains temporary build artifacts that you have not yet released. 
2)  A remote in Git is a common repository that all team members use to exchange their changes. In most cases, such a remote repository is stored on a code hosting service like GitHub or on an internal server. In contrast to a local repository, a remote typically does not provide a file tree of the project's current state.
3)  If all of the developers have commit access to the repo, you should not need to do anything special. They will pull changes from the repo, make their own changes, commit locally, and then push back into the public repo when they have something working. If on the other hand you have one (or a few) developer(s) responsible for committing to the repo, and the others are providing patches to these. Have each of them clone the repo into their own accounts and have them send pull-requests when they have a change they want into the main repo. It's also possible to make specific clones for working on specific features if you wish. Using the same workflow with pull-requests to get changes into the main repo when the feature is done. If by "All developers will have one universal account" you mean that all developers will share one GitHub account and appear as the same committer in the repo, that's a bad idea. Make separate accounts and set them up as collaborators if you want them all to have commit access.
